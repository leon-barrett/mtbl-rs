# mtbl Rust Library

This library provides an idiomatic Rust interface to the
[mtbl](https://github.com/farsightsec/mtbl) C library for dealing with
SSTables (write-once sorted map files).

SSTables are basically constant on-disk maps, like those used by
[CDB](http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html) (which also has [Rust
bindings](https://github.com/andrew-d/tinycdb-rs), except using sorted maps
instead of hashmaps. For more information, see the [mtbl
README](https://github.com/farsightsec/mtbl).

Version 0.2.X of mtbl covers the 0.8 version of the MTBL C library.

## Dependencies

In order to use the `mtbl` crate, you must have a Unix system with the
`libmtbl` library installed where it can be found by `pkg-config`.

On Debian-based Linux distributions, install the `libmtbl-dev` package:

```
sudo apt-get install libmtbl-dev
```

## Usage

Add `mtbl` as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mtbl = "0.2.1"
```

```rust
extern crate mtbl;

// Create a database, using a Sorter instead of a Writer so we
// can add keys in arbitrary (non-sorted) order.
use mtbl::{Sorter,Write};
{
  let mut writer = mtbl::Sorter::create_from_path("data.mtbl");
  writer.add("key", "value");
  // Data is flushed to file when the writer/sorter is destroyed.
}

// Read from a database
use mtbl::{Read,Reader};
let reader = mtbl::Reader::open("data.mtbl");
// Get one element
let val: Option(Vec<u8>) = reader.get("key");
assert_eq!(val, Option("value".as_bytes()));
// Or iterate over all entries
for (key: Vec<u8>, value: Vec<u8>) in &reader {
    f(key, value);
}
```

## More details about MTBL

Quoting from the MTBL documentation:

> mtbl is not a database library. It does not provide an updateable
> key-value data store, but rather exposes primitives for creating,
> searching and merging SSTable files. Unlike databases which use the
> SSTable data structure internally as part of their data store, management
> of SSTable files -- creation, merging, deletion, combining of search
> results from multiple SSTables -- is left to the discretion of the mtbl
> library user.

> mtbl SSTable files consist of a sequence of data blocks containing sorted
> key-value pairs, where keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays. Data
> blocks are optionally compressed using zlib or the Snappy library. The
> data blocks are followed by an index block, allowing for fast searches
> over the keyspace.

> The basic mtbl interface is the writer, which receives a sequence of
> key-value pairs in sorted order with no duplicate keys, and writes them
> to data blocks in the SSTable output file. An index containing offsets to
> data blocks and the last key in each data block is buffered in memory
> until the writer object is closed, at which point the index is written to
> the end of the SSTable file. This allows SSTable files to be written in a
> single pass with sequential I/O operations only.

> Once written, SSTable files can be searched using the mtbl reader
> interface. Searches can retrieve key-value pairs based on an exact key
> match, a key prefix match, or a key range. Results are retrieved using a
> simple iterator interface.

> The mtbl library also provides two utility interfaces which facilitate a
> sort-and-merge workflow for bulk data loading. The sorter interface
> receives arbitrarily ordered key-value pairs and provides them in sorted
> order, buffering to disk as needed. The merger interface reads from
> multiple SSTables simultaneously and provides the key-value pairs from
> the combined inputs in sorted order. Since mtbl does not allow duplicate
> keys in an SSTable file, both the sorter and merger interfaces require a
> caller-provided merge function which will be called to merge multiple
> values for the same key. These interfaces also make use of sequential I/O
> operations only.

## Why prefer MTBL over CDB or other constant databases?

* Storing data in sorted order makes merging files easy.
* Compression is built-in (options: [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) and
  [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy)).
* The library code is a little more modern and uses mmapped files to have
  a properly immutable (and therefore thread-safe) representation -- it
  doesn't go mucking about with file pointers.
